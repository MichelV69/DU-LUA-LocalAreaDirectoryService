# DU-LUA-LocalAreaDirectoryService
*GPS Coord / WP Directory for Points of Interest / Shops, etc*

Projects like "Starlantis" and "Nitro City" are massive sprawls, with so many things to see and find. This is a tool designed to help with that need.

A central databank JSON database holds the "Master Copy" of the DB. "You Are Here" stations keep local copies that test for updates any time a YAH-Station is used.

A simple touch-screen directory will set a GPS Way Point for the user after they pick what they'd like to find / see / go-to.
